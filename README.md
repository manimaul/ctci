This repository is my attempt to study for Coding Interview questions.  
The solutions found here may not necessarily represent the "best" solution as they represent real life practice using a simple text editory, the command line, a white board and little to no internet help except for if I'm really stuck.  

Practice questions taken from "Cracking The Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
